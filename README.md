**Verdict:** Veritas combines the best of search engines, AI chatbots, and specialized verification tools into one autonomous system. While Perplexity excels at search and ChatGPT at conversation, only Veritas deploys multiple agents working together for comprehensive truth verification. The Quint and Google tools are valuable but limited to manual processes and publisher tools respectively.
**Pain Point:** Traders risk massive financial losses by acting on viral market rumors, fake earnings reports, or manipulated stock news that can crash portfolios in minutes.

**Veritas Solution:** Our Corporate Intelligence Engine provides real-time news verification with a Reliability Score, sentiment analysis, and temporal tracking. Traders get a "market truth dashboard" showing verified vs. fake news ratios, preventing costly decisions based on misinformation.

### For Journalists & Newsrooms
**Pain Point:** Journalists face intense deadline pressure to publish accurate stories, but verifying claims across multiple sources takes hours, risking the spread of unverified information.

**Veritas Solution:** The Main Agent routes queries instantly to specialized verifiers. Journalists can upload audio interviews for transcription and fact-checking, or scan crisis trends proactively. Our synthesis agent creates professional, sourced responses in seconds.

### For YouTubers & Content Creators
**Pain Point:** Content creators risk platform strikes, demonetization, or legal issues from sharing unverified claims, manipulated images, or trending but false narratives in their videos.

**Veritas Solution:** Visual claim extraction from screenshots prevents sharing fake tweet graphics. The Chrome extension allows right-click verification of scripts or articles. Voice mode enables real-time brainstorming with built-in fact-checking.

### For Researchers & Academics
**Pain Point:** Researchers need deep, structured analysis with citations, not just "True/False" labels. Generic tools lack the depth and source grounding required for academic work.

**Veritas Solution:** Confidence scoring (0.0-1.0), bias assessment, and comprehensive source grounding provide academic-grade verification. The synthesis agent structures findings into professional reports with evidence paragraphs.

## 🔄 How It Works: Complete Agent Flows & Explanations

Veritas employs a sophisticated agent orchestration system, inspired by real A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication protocols. Here's the complete breakdown of how our 4 specialized agents collaborate across all use cases:

### 1. Main Agent → Check Agent Flow (Core Fact-Checking Pipeline)
```
User Query → Main Agent (Intelligent Routing) → Check Agent (Multi-Source Verification) → Synthesis Agent (Professional Response)
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Main Agent Analysis**: Uses Gemini 2.5 Flash to understand query intent, determines if fact-checking is needed
- **Check Agent Execution**: Performs Google Search with grounding, analyzes 5+ sources, calculates confidence scores (0.0-1.0)
- **Synthesis Agent**: Structures response with verdict emojis, evidence paragraphs, and source citations
- **Example**: "Is 5G linked to COVID-19?" → VERDICT: FAKE, CONFIDENCE: 0.95 → Professional explanation with WHO sources

**Use Cases**: Journalists verifying claims, Traders checking market rumors, Researchers validating data

### 2. Main Agent → Scan Crisis Flow (Proactive Misinformation Detection)
```
User/Crisis Trigger → Main Agent → Scan Crisis Action → Batch Check Agent Calls → Trend Analysis → Dashboard Report
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Crisis Detection**: Monitors trending topics using Google Search trends
- **Automated Scanning**: Finds top 3-5 viral claims per crisis
- **Parallel Verification**: Check Agent processes multiple claims simultaneously
- **Trend Analytics**: Aggregates severity levels, volume metrics, and emerging patterns
- **Example**: Ukraine conflict → Scans for "Russia won Kyiv", "Peace treaty signed" → Real-time dashboard with verified corrections

**Use Cases**: Breaking news monitoring, Crisis response teams, Content moderation

### 3. Main Agent → Process Image Flow (Visual Content Verification)
```
Image Upload → Main Agent → Image Agent (OCR + Extraction) → Check Agent (Claim Verification) → Verified Output
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Image Agent**: Uses Gemini Vision to extract text, claims, and context from images/screenshots
- **Claim Isolation**: Identifies specific factual claims (headlines, social posts, charts)
- **Cross-Verification**: Check Agent validates against real data sources
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains original image context in verification results
- **Example**: Viral tweet screenshot → Extracts "Stock crashed 50%" → Verifies against NYSE data → "FAKE: Actually +0.3%"

**Use Cases**: Social media verification, News screenshot checking, Visual misinformation detection

### 4. Voice Interaction Flow (Real-Time Conversational Verification)
```
User Speech → Transcriber Agent → Live Gemini Session → Tool Calls → Check Agent → Voice Response Synthesis
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Audio Transcription**: Real-time speech-to-text with WebRTC
- **Live AI Session**: Gemini 2.5 Flash maintains conversation context
- **Dynamic Tool Calling**: Automatically invokes verification when factual questions detected
- **Voice Response**: Synthesized audio responses with natural conversation flow
- **Example**: "Does electric vehicle production hurt the environment?" → Live verification → Voice explanation with EPA data

**Use Cases**: Podcasting, Interviews, Accessibility for visually impaired users

### 5. Company Intelligence Flow (Enterprise Analysis Pipeline)
```
Company Registration → Agent 1 (Web Discovery) → Agent 2 (News Aggregation) → Agent 3 (Verification) → Dashboard Storage → Conversational Interface
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Agent 1**: Searches for official websites, social media, investor relations
- **Agent 2**: Executes 5 targeted searches for 30 news items across categories
- **Agent 3**: Cross-references each news item with official sources, assigns bias/impact scores
- **Temporal Storage**: MongoDB graph database with timestamped relationships
- **Query Interface**: Natural language queries like "Show negative news from last week"

**Use Cases**: Corporate reputation monitoring, Investor due diligence, Brand protection

### 6. Data Query Flow (Conversational Analytics)
```
User Question → Query Routing Agent → Database Retrieval → AI Analysis Agent → Natural Language Response
```

**Detailed Process:**
- **Intent Classification**: Determines query type (statistics, sources, timeline, etc.)
- **Smart Filtering**: Applies date ranges, verdict filters, category filters
- **AI Synthesis**: Transforms raw data into conversational insights
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains data relationships and temporal context
- **Example**: "How has our reliability score changed?" → Analyzes trend data → "Improved 15% this month due to fewer fake news items"

**Use Cases**: Executive reporting, Stakeholder communication, Data-driven decision making

### System Architecture Benefits
- **Scalability**: Agents can process hundreds of queries simultaneously
- **Accuracy**: Multi-source verification with confidence scoring
- **Speed**: Sub-second responses for most queries
- **Reliability**: Fallback mechanisms and error recovery
- **Extensibility**: New agents can be added for specialized verification tasks

## 🏢 Company Intelligence Dashboard

### Registration & Profile Creation
Companies register via secure API endpoints, creating profiles with basic info (name, industry, website).

### Agent 1: Web Presence Discovery
```
Company Name from DB → Agent 1 → Google Search → Official Websites + Social Media + Investor Relations
```

**Example:** For "Tesla Inc."
- Finds official website: tesla.com
- Social: twitter.com/tesla, linkedin.com/company/tesla
- Investor: ir.tesla.com

### Agent 2: Multi-Source News Aggregation
```
Company Name → Agent 2 → 5 Targeted Google Searches → 30 News Items (Financial, Product, Legal, etc.)
```

**Categories:** Breaking News (12), Financial (10), Product/Innovation (8), Partnerships (6), Legal/Regulatory (4)

### Agent 3: Cross-Reference Verification
```
News Items + Official Sources → Agent 3 → Verification Engine → VERDICT + Confidence + Bias + Impact
```

**Enhanced Analysis:** Each news item gets bias assessment, impact rating, and detailed reasoning.

### Temporal Graph Storage
